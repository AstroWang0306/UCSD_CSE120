 1.  Install a faster CPU: not much help, it can improve the CPU performace but not the utlization as CPU is not the control of the utlization
 2.  Install a bigger paging disk: not much help, there is no storage issues
 3.  Increase the degree of multiprogramming: can possibly improve. However, it may also requires more resources then lead to more faults
 4.  Decrease the degree of multiprogramming: can possibly improve. However, if less program are being executed, it may need more time wait other operations being completed
 5.  Install more main memory: highly possible to improve as it can reduce the page faults
 6.  Install a faster hard disk, or multiple controllers with multiple hard disks: can improve overall performace but may not directly impact the CPU utilization
 7.  Add prepaging to the page-fetch algorithms: 
 8.  Increase the page size
